## SVG Polygons on a Canvas
- http://creative-exercise-nnewt1.glitch.me, or alternatively start server with `node server.js` and go to `localhost:3000`.
- SVG/Canvas
- Used W3 Schools Tutorials to learn how to use both SVGs and the Canvas. https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_drawing.asp https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_polygon.asp
- Program currently displays a blue hexagon, a green triangle, and a color gradient hexagon in a row on the canvas in `index.html`. When the "Change Polygon" button is pressed, the 3 shapes will move to a new location and be a new size somewhere within the canvas. The shapes can't be changed from the webpage itself, but `polygon.js` is configured to create polygons of all shapes and colors as the coder sees fit.
