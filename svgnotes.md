Source: W3Schools SVG Tutorial & Canvas Tutorial

Note: Since SVG is written in XML, remember this:
All elements must be properly closed
XML is case-sensitive, so write all SVG elements and attributes in same case. We prefer lower-case
Place all attribute values in SVG inside quotes (even if they are numbers)


Canvas drawing starts by getting canvas element by id and then using getContext("2d") method.
